PIP

Not exactly rocket science :)

``pip install HueBLE``


Manual
------

HueBLE consists of a single file (``HueBLE.py``) which you can simply put in the
same directory as your program. If you are using manual installation make sure
the dependencies are installed as well.

``pip install bleak bleak-retry-connector``
